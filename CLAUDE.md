# CLAUDE.md — QBot / FlySky project

Guidance for Claude Code (and humans) working in this repo.

## What this is
**FlySky** is building **QBot**: a pet-like companion robot that recognises its
owner and reacts to hand gestures. Vision comes from a **Kinect 360 (Xbox Kinect
v1)** RGB-D camera; the mobile base is a **Kobuki / Quanser QBot**. Everything
runs on **ROS 2 Jazzy**.

Read `QBOT_OVERVIEW.md` (technical/system overview) and
`team_flysky_project.md` (project proposal, timeline, task split) for full context.

## Hardware / environment
- **Board:** Raspberry Pi 5, 4 GB RAM — keep things light (ros-base, not desktop;
  Python nodes over heavy C++ where reasonable).
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble), arm64.
- **ROS distro:** Jazzy.
- **Camera:** Kinect v1 / 360 over USB (libfreenect). Vendor `045e`.
- **Base:** Kobuki (kobuki.readthedocs.io). *Not yet connected — wire-up pending.*

## Repository layout
This repo **is** the colcon workspace (referred to as `qbot_ws` in the docs).

```
src/
  kinect_camera/   kinect_rgbd            -> /kinect/rgb/image_raw, /kinect/depth/image_raw
  vision_node/     face_tracker_node      -> /vision/target
  gesture_node/    gesture_command_node   -> /gesture/tracking
  behavior_node/   pet_behavior_node      -> /cmd_vel, /commands/sound
                   launch/qbot.launch.py  (full-system bringup)
setup_qbot_env.sh  one-shot environment installer (ROS 2 + deps + Kinect udev)
```

All four packages are `ament_python`.

## Common commands
```bash
# One-time environment install (ROS 2 Jazzy + deps + Kinect permissions)
bash setup_qbot_env.sh

# Build
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash

# Run a single node / the whole system
ros2 launch kinect_camera kinect_rgbd.launch.py
ros2 launch behavior_node qbot.launch.py

# Inspect
ros2 topic list
ros2 topic echo /vision/target
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel
```

## Status & conventions
- Node bodies are **working scaffolds**: the graph wires up and runs end-to-end,
  but the Kinect driver, gesture classifier, and Kobuki base driver are filled in
  once the hardware is attached (look for `TODO` markers).
- Topic names and node names match `QBOT_OVERVIEW.md` — keep them in sync if you
  change one.
- Nodes are written to **start cleanly without hardware** (e.g. the Kinect node
  runs in a no-device mode and warns instead of crashing), so the rest of the
  graph stays testable.
- Tune behavior in `src/behavior_node/config/behavior.yaml`; keep indoor speeds
  gentle and preserve the input watchdog (no runaway on stale data).

## Hardware status (verified 2026-06-18)
- **ROS 2 Jazzy** installed; workspace builds clean with `colcon build --symlink-install`.
- **Kinect**: working end-to-end. `kinect_rgbd` publishes RGB @ ~30 Hz (640×480 rgb8)
  and depth (640×480 16UC1). The `freenect` Python module was built from source
  (not in apt) and installed to `/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/`.
- **Kobuki**: working. Driver connects over `/dev/kobuki` (HW 1.0.4 / FW 1.1.4),
  publishes `/odom` + `/sensors/core`. Built from source (`kobuki_core` +
  `kobuki_node` + full `ecl` stack) since they're not in apt for Jazzy; built into
  `src/` and gitignored. `qbot.launch.py` now brings up the base too.

### Kobuki operational notes
- Velocity input is **`/commands/velocity`** (geometry_msgs/Twist), NOT `/cmd_vel`.
  The behavior node's `cmd_vel_topic` is pointed there in the bringup launch.
- Its `/commands/sound` uses a typed `kobuki Sound` msg — our behavior node emits
  abstract cues on **`/qbot/sound`** instead to avoid a topic-type clash.
- The `ecl` source builds with `-Werror` which fails on Ubuntu 24.04's GCC; the
  installer patches `ecl_cxx.cmake` to drop it. `kobuki_keyop` is skipped (needs
  the unpackaged `cmd_vel_mux`).
- Build on the Pi with limited parallelism to avoid OOM (2 GB swap helps):
  `MAKEFLAGS="-j2" colcon build --symlink-install --parallel-workers 1`

### Kinect operational notes / gotchas
- The kernel `gspca_kinect` driver must stay blacklisted (done in
  `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-kinect.conf`) or libfreenect can't claim the camera.
- The libfreenect **sync API leaves the USB device claimed** if a process is hard-
  killed without `freenect.sync_stop()`. Always stop the node with Ctrl-C / SIGINT
  (the node calls `sync_stop()` in its `finally`). Never `kill -9` it.
- If the camera/audio drop off the bus or won't open, recover with:
  `sudo python3 scripts/kinect_usb_reset.py`
- The Kinect 360 needs its **external 12 V power adapter** (Y-cable) — USB bus power
  alone runs only the motor; the camera/audio drop out without it.

## Gesture control (implemented)
MediaPipe has no ARM64 wheel, but **onnxruntime does**. Gestures are recognised
from the Kinect **RGB** feed with OpenCV model-zoo's converted MediaPipe models
(palm detection + 21 hand landmarks), vendored in `gesture_node/mp_models/` and
run under onnxruntime (`gesture_node/hand_tracker.py`). A temporal state machine
(`gesture_node/gesture_classifier.py`) turns finger states + motion into command
events; the behavior node (`pet_behavior_node`) runs each as a closed-loop
maneuver off `/odom`.

> An earlier depth-silhouette approach was tried and abandoned: at arm's length
> the Kinect depth blob couldn't separate an open palm from a fist (solidity
> ~0.80 vs ~0.91). The ONNX landmark model gives ~100% detection at 0.98+
> confidence and reliable per-finger states. Models live in `models/` /
> `src/gesture_node/models/` (git-ignored, downloaded by `setup_qbot_env.sh`);
> `onnxruntime` is a pip dependency (not apt/rosdep).

| Gesture | Command | Robot behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Open palm, held | `stop` | Halt immediately (interrupts anything) |
| Curl the hand twice (open↔fist ×2) | `forward` | Drive forward until stopped |
| Closed fist, held ~1 s | `backward` | Drive backward until stopped |
| Index finger drawing a circle in the air | `rotate360` | Spin a full 360° in place |
| Open-hand swipe to image-left | `turn_left` | Sidestep left: turn +90°, advance, turn back to face you |
| Open-hand swipe to image-right | `turn_right` | Sidestep right (mirror) |
| Rapid open-hand wave side-to-side | `tail_wag` | Oscillate left-right 3× |
| (idle, face seen) | — | Wiggle every ~10 s |

- **All 7 verified live** with a real hand (calibration session 2026-06-18), and
  maneuvers verified in closed-loop sim (rotate360 ≈ 360°, sidesteps net ±0.30 m
  at original heading, forward/stop, idle wiggle).
- Notes from calibration: a wrapped thumb often miscounts as one finger, so a
  fist reads `fingers==1` — `is_closed` accepts ≤1 finger when *not* pointing
  (`index_only`). The rotate circle is detected from the fingertip's absolute
  path (works whether the finger pivots or the whole hand moves).
- Run the gesture node with `-p debug:=true` to log `fingers/index_only/cx`.
  Tune `swipe_dx`, `process_hz`, and the classifier thresholds as needed.
- Continuous drive (`forward`/`backward`) has a `drive_timeout` safety cap so a
  missed `stop` can't run away.

## Still to do
- Owner recognition: add to `face_tracker_node` (currently largest-face tracking).
- Depth-aware collision avoidance in `pet_behavior_node`.
- On-hand gesture-threshold calibration (see above).
